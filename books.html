      <h2><em>In Progress: War Theatre: Dancing American Empire during World War II</em></h2>
      <p>
        This project investigates domestic and global wartime dance practices as contested cultural formations. The project was inspired when I discovered a trove of photographs commissioned by the U.S. military and Office of War Information of dance practices in the U.S. National Archives in a collection called “War Theatre,” which has become the title of the book. Focusing on the visual remains of wartime dance practices in “theaters of war,” I ask questions about the interplays between U.S. national security concerns and practices/conditions of embodiment. I argue that dancing during World War II was a source of pleasure, resilience, and creativity as well as coercion and governmental disciplinary power. Analysis of my sources reveals thus unremarked features of the American empire in the mid-20th century, managed through the administration of embodied practices of discipline, choreographies of coordinated force, and spatial partitioning and exclusion among other techniques. I contend that dancing in these contexts illuminates how bodies adopted and adapted to U.S. power in pursuit of the nation’s geo-political interests and expansion. At the same time, I illuminate how dance reveals tensions within American democracy between discipline and personal expression, which, I argue, was manifest in how dancers enlisted bodily/movement to manage their experiences of war.
