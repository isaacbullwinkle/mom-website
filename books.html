      <h2>In Progress: <em>War Theatre: Dancing American Empire during World War II</em></h2>
      <p>
        This project investigates domestic and global wartime dance practices as contested cultural formations. The project was inspired when I discovered a trove of photographs commissioned by the U.S. military and Office of War Information of dance practices in the U.S. National Archives in a collection called “War Theatre,” which has become the title of the book. Focusing on the visual remains of wartime dance practices in “theaters of war,” I ask questions about the interplays between U.S. national security concerns and practices/conditions of embodiment. I argue that dancing during World War II was a source of pleasure, resilience, and creativity as well as coercion and governmental disciplinary power. Analysis of my sources reveals thus unremarked features of the American empire in the mid-20th century, managed through the administration of embodied practices of discipline, choreographies of coordinated force, and spatial partitioning and exclusion among other techniques. I contend that dancing in these contexts illuminates how bodies adopted and adapted to U.S. power in pursuit of the nation’s geo-political interests and expansion. At the same time, I illuminate how dance reveals tensions within American democracy between discipline and personal expression, which, I argue, was manifest in how dancers enlisted bodily/movement to manage their experiences of war.

        </ul>
        The book investigates how dance artists, critics, and audiences contested what it meant to stage globalism in the 1940s against the backdrop of emerging American geopolitical and cultural dominance during and after World War II. I show how individuals and communities that formed around a common investment in international dance performance engaged in imagining America’s role as a global superpower and a geopolitics with the US at its center. I argue that in dance, as in cultural politics, Americans struggled over whether and/or how to become a heterogeneous and inclusive nation. At issue was the country’s fraught relationship with diversity in both international and domestic spheres, characterized by dueling impulses toward openness, multiculturalism, and multilateralism, all key components of postwar globalism, on the one hand, and nationalism, containment, homogeneity, and isolationism, vestiges of nativist and racist American cultural legacies, on the other.

      <h2><em>How To Do Things with Dance: Performing Change in Postwar America</em> (2010), Wesleyan University Press (cloth edition)</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>Received the 2012 Outstanding Publication Award given by the Congress on Research in Dance (CORD)</li>
        </ul>
        The book examines the significance of the contributions of modern dancers, dance makers, and viewers to undercurrents of aesthetic and social change in the U.S. during the postwar years, illuminating a convergence of choreographic approaches defining dance movement in terms of action, and the body’s endeavors as constitutive in social and political senses. Chapters build to illustrate artistic treatments of the stage as a penetrable space, one on which socially suspect, sanctioned, or marginalized modes of being and doing could be performed with relative impunity and projected into the real world. In its focus on the politics of embodiment rather than on artistic aesthetic priorities, the book departs from existing scholarship centered on the avant-garde, which tends to marginalize the work of artists of color, highlighting instead a pluralistic view of the field.
